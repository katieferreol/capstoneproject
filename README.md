# "WHAT WAS SHE WEARING? (2023)"

Kathleen Marie (Katie) Ferreolâ€™s Exhibition What Was She Wearing is a three part-interactive installation that brings light to sexual harassment of females in public spaces. Misogyny has existed for decades, but bringing interactive art shows that, with the development of technology also brings a new wave of dangers for women. Katie hopes that this exhibition will spur conversation and create a voice for women whose experiences go unheard.
